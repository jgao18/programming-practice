takes a string, uses a hash function, gives an index to look into an array

infinite strings, finite hash codes. Collision may occur, when the same string hashes to the same index.

Solution > Chainging - take that array index and turn it into a linked list, containing the key and the item

constant time O(1) often, linear time worst case O(n)
